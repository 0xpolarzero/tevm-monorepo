# @evmts/docs

Under construction

This repo was originally forked from [docs.astro.build](https://docs.astro.build/).
This repo contains all the source code we use to build our docs site.

## We are EVMts

EVMts is an experimental projecting bringing the evm to frontend development.
We want everyone to be successful building trustless apps, and that means helping everyone understand how Astro works.
