# Quick start

Use cli to get started with EVMts fast

## Overview

EVMts ships with a cli tool to automate your setup. You can either start a new project or modify an existing setup.

If you prefer a manual setup, [skip to installation instructions](./installation.md)

## Start a new project

To scaffold a new project, run `@evmts/create` and follow along with the prompts

```bash
npx @evmts/create my-app
```

It will create a new TypeScript-Vite project with evmts preconfigured

## Add to existing project

To add evmts to an existing project, run `@evmts/add` and follow along with the prompts.

```bash
npx @evmts/add
```
