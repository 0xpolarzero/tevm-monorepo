# Plugin configuration

Two build tools are provided to give you an optimized dev experience working with Solidity contracts in TS

- @evmts/rollup-plugin allows you to import solidity files directly into typescript
- @evmts/ts-plugin gives you typescript inference and autocompletion for your your solidity contract imports
