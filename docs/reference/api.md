# API Reference

EVMts is a pretty light wrapper around [forge scripts](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-script) and [viem](https://viem.sh/). EVMts stays as close to both of these tools as possible in it's API design.

Anyone already familiar with Foundry and Viem can head over to the [online demo](https://todo.stackblitz.lol)
